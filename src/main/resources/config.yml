# config for LimitRedstone Plugin
# To reload the config, please use /RLimiter reload!

# This will remove redstone on chunkload if it is over the limit you set! By default I have this disabled since it could mess with players current redstone contraptions.
# However if this is enabled it can remove preexisting redstone lag machines!
LimitRedstoneOnChunkLoad: false

# This will prevent redstone from bring placed if there is more than your limit!
LimitRedstonePlaced: true

# Max Redstone per chunk! I highly advise you to change this since It could either be too high or too low!
MaxRedstonePerChunk: 40

# Debug mode! By default this is disabled since it can cause a lot of flood into your console. If you are a small server, you can turn this on though!
# It allows you to see who might be trying to exploit redstone on your server!
Debug: false

# This will disable redstone currents if it is more than your max redstone per chunk!
DisableRedstoneAtMaxPerChunk: true
